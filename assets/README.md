# Assets

In this directory live all assets for `ExDoc`. The built, ready-to-use
versions are found in `formatters/{html,epub}/dist`.

To work on these assets you need to install [Node.js] (version 10) and
[NPM] (version 5.6) first (maybe as superuser or administrator).

## `npm run` scripts

The following scripts are available

### `build`

This will build a complete production bundle, including JavaScript and CSS.
If you run `mix build` at the `ExDoc` root after changing your assets, it will
automatically recompile the assets, invoke `mix compile --force`, and generate
fresh docs with your changes.

### `lint`

Lint all JavaScript files using [ESLint].

### `test`

Run all the available JavaScript tests using [Karma].

### `watch`

Builds JavaScript and CSS on file changes for each format.

## Webpack

Internally we use [Webpack]. We also use [Less] for organizing stylesheets.
