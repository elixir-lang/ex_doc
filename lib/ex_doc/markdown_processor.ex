  ExDoc is compatible with markdown processors that implement this behaviour.

  """

  @doc """
  Converts markdown into HTML.
  """
  @callback to_html(String.t, Keyword.t) :: String.t

  @doc """
  Assets specific to the markdown implementation.

  This callback takes the documentation format (`:html` or `epub`) as an argument
  and must return a list of pairs of the form: `{basename, content}` where:

    * `basename` relative path that will be written inside the `doc/` directory.
    * `content` is a binary with the full contents of the file that will be written to `basename`.

  ## EPUB Documentation Gotchas

  Generating HTML documentation is simple, and it works exacly as you would expect for a webpage.
  The EPUB file format, on the other hand, may cause some surprise.

  Apparently, an EPUB file expects all assets to have a unique name *when discarding the file extension*.

  This creates problems if you include, for example, the files `custom.js` and `custom.css`.
  Because the filename without the extension is equal (`custom`), you will get an unreadable EPUB.
  It's possible to go around this limitation by simply giving the files unique names:

    * `custom.js` becomes `custom-js.js` *and*
    * `custom.css` becomes `custom-css.css`

  ## Example

      def callback assets(_) do
        [{"dist/custom-css.css", custom_css_content()},
         {"dist/custom-js.js", custom_js_content()}]
      end
  """
  @callback assets(atom) :: [{String.t, String.t}]

  @doc """
  Literal content to be written to the file just before the closing head tag.

  This callback takes the documentation format (`:html` or `epub`) as an argument
  and returns a literal string.
  It is useful when the markdown processor needs to a include extra CSS.

  ## Example

      def callback before_closing_head_tag(_) do
        # Include the CSS specified in the assets/1 callback
        ~S(<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/custom-css.css"/>)

  """
  @callback before_closing_head_tag(atom) :: String.t

  @doc """
  Literal content to be written to the file just before the closing body tag.

  This callback takes the documentation format (`:html` or `epub`) as an argument
  and returns a literal string.
  It is useful when the markdown processor needs to a include extra Javascript.
  The result of this function is written directly to the output file.

  ## Example

      def callback before_closing_body_tag(_) do
        # Include the Javascript specified in the assets/1 callback
        ~S(<script src="dist/custom-js.js"></script>)
      end

  @callback before_closing_body_tag(atom) :: String.t

  @doc """
  A function that accepts configuration options and configures the markdown processor.

  It is run once when `ex_doc` is loaded, and the return value is discarded.
  Modules that implement this behaviour will probably store the options somewhere
  so that they can be accessed when needed.

  The format of the options as well as what the function does with them is
  completely up to the module that implements the behaviour.
